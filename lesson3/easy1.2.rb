#Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:
# ! is used as NOT. can also be seen after certain methods to indicate 
#the method mutates the caller


    #what is != and where should you use it?
    # comes to mean not equal to. can we used as an equality operator to 
    #compare ojects and have a boolean returned
    
    #put ! before something, like !user_name
    #changes object to their opposite boolean 
    
    #put ! after something, like words.uniq!
    #shows method mutates the caller. not every method that mutates has '!'
    
    #put ? before something
    #like ternary operator
    
    #put ? after something
    #part of the name of a method
    
    #put !! before something, like !!user_name
    #changes object to their boolean
