1.  a method that returns the sum of two integers 

START
#given two integers

first integers is added to second integer

sum of both integers is given

END 

------ 

2. a method that takes an array of strings, 
   and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together.

START 
#array of strings is given

separate strings inside of array are squished together
squished new string inside of an array taken out of the array

PRINT new STRING 
END 

-----

3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns
  a new array with every other element from the original array, 
  starting with the first element

START 
#given an array of integers

iterate through each intger one by one
keeps only every other integer (starting with saving the first integer)
the kept integers are put in a new array
name the new array

PRINT new array. 

--------- 

4. a method that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a 
given character in a string. For instance, if the given character 
is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the method should 
return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x').
If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return nil. 

START
#given a string
#given a character
iterate through every character of string 
counts each time given character shows up
on third time given character shows up
PUTS place third time is located 
IF character shows up less than three times
PUTS nil

END 
-----

a method that takes two arrays of numbers and 
returns the result of merging the arrays. The elements of the first 
array should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned array,
while the elements of the second array should become the elements 
at the odd indexes

START 
#given two arrays of numbers
a new array is made 
numbers in first array given takes even-numbered seats(indexes) of new array
numbers in second array given takes odd-numbered seats(indexes) of new array
PUTS new array

END
